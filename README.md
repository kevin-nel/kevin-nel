### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kevin.

I am an electronic engineering student interested in music production, programming, technology and diy.
I tend towards being somewhat of a generalist in my endevours and pride myself on learning and having a broad knowledge.

You can see what I am up to on [my webiste](https://kevinnel.com) or on [my mastodon](https://merveilles.town/@kevin).
